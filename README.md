## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments from tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models. The main objective is to classify tweets into sentiment categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral, providing insights into public opinion and trends.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Twitter Sentiment Dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakashpraba/twitter-sentiment-analysis-dataset)
- Columns:
  - tweet → Original tweet text
  - label → Sentiment label (0 = Negative, 1 = Neutral, 2 = Positive)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
  - Removal of URLs, mentions (@user), hashtags, numbers, and special characters
  - Conversion to lowercase
  - Stopwords removal using NLTK
  - Lemmatization for reducing words to base form

🧼 Preprocessing
- Removed URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters
- Converted text to lowercase
- Removed stopwords using NLTK
- Tokenized and cleaned tweets for modeling
def clean_text(text):
    # Removes noise and stopwords



📊 Feature Extraction
- Technique: TF-IDF Vectorization
- Max Features: 5000
- Converts cleaned tweets into numerical vectors for model input

🤖 Model Implementation
- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Split: 80% training / 20% testing
- Libraries: scikit-learn
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)



📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))



📊 Visual Insights
- Sentiment distribution bar chart
- Word clouds for positive and negative tweets
- Optional: ROC curve and feature importance
sns.countplot(x='sentiment', data=df)
